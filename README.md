Intelligent automobile recommendation platform is an active recommendation system, supporting both Android and IOS two major platforms. Meanwhile, a mobile app is presented to the users, which can run on a mobile phone or an onboard computer.
Big data architecture is used in IARP, with Spark as computing framework, Machine learning methods as core algorithm, cloud computing as customer service.


Intelligent automobile recommendation platform contains the following functions:

-Initiative and passive recommendation of places of interests(POI)
-Speech recognition and interaction
-Intelligent navigation


Methodology including:

-Parking action recognition
-Matching of parking location 
-Speech recognition
-Classification method (LR, GBDT, Naive Bayes)
-Collaborative filtering


 users to connect app we recommend intelligent driving cloud, the purpose of our development is to remind car drivers will be happened, ahead of time travel, driving vehicle driving personnel, maintenance and repair work, system of intelligent driving assistant work, the system USES is the big data technology architecture, spark as computing framework, machine learning analysis of user behavior, cloud computing as a customer service.

User usage scenarios are as follows:
1. At 7:20, I always send my children to the kindergarten, and give advice on parking places on the road.
2. There was a heavy traffic jam on the way home at 20:00 at night, and suggested taking another route.
3. The car is going to run out of gas, and it is suggested that we go to the nearest economic discount gas station.
4. There is a new children's park near my home on Saturday, which is suggested to take my children to the amusement park.

write anywhere: Build mobile apps with React.

- **Build native mobile apps using JavaScript and React:** React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.
- **A React Native app is a real mobile app:** With React Native, you don't build a "mobile web app", an "HTML5 app", or a "hybrid app". You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C, Java, or Swift. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.
- **Don't waste time recompiling:** React Native lets you build your app faster. Instead of recompiling, you can reload your app instantly. With hot reloading, you can even run new code while retaining your application state. Give it a try - it's a magical experience.
- **Use native code when you need to:** React Native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, or Swift. It's simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of your application. It's also easy to build part of your app in React Native, and part of your app using native code directly - that's how the Facebook app works.

The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about - learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native.

See the official [React Native website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for an introduction to React Native.

Supported operating systems are >= Android 4.1 (API 16) and >= iOS 8.0.
